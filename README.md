A python based tool to implement Genomic Prediction Experiments using Deep Learning

### The Software

The DeepGP package implements Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP),
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression to Genomic Prediction purposes.
Our package takes advantage of Autonomio Talos [Computer software] (2019) ( http://github.com/autonomio/talos) functionalities to
optimize the networks  parameters. It also implements uni and
multi-trait experiments with a set of normalization options.
We believe it can be a useful tool for people who want to
implement Deep Learning models for predicting complex traits in an
easy way.

### Introduction

Deep Learning (DL) techniques comprise a heterogeneous collection of Machine Learning
algorithms which have excelled at prediction tasks.
All DL algorithms employ multiple neuron layers and numerous
architectures have been proposed.
DL is relatively easy to implement (https://keras.io/why-use-keras/) but
is not 'plug and play' and the DL performance highly depends of the
hyperparameter combination.

Genomic Selection is the breeding strategy
consisting in predicting complex traits using
genomic-wide genetic markers and it is standard in many animal and
plant breeding schemes. Its powerful predictive ability makes
DL a suitable tool for prediction problems. Here, we deliver a tool
 to predicting complex traits
from whole genome SNP information in a easy way.
This is thanks to Keras API (https://keras.io/) and TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/), which allow all intricacies to be encapsulated through very simple statements. TensorFlow is a machine-learning library developed by Google.
We also take advantage of the scikit learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
to surrender classical penalized models for prediction purposes.

The novelty of our tool lies in the fact that it allows us to tune
the most important  hyperparameters in CNN and MLP architectures.

 ### GP main features

  - It allows tuning the MLP and CNN architectues for GP purposes
  - Our package uses a random search for hyperparameter optimization.
  - It is easy to implement
  - It delivers all the parameters to implemented models
   allowing you to explore the hyperparameters influence

### What is a hyperparameter in DL jargon?

  Hyperparameters are variables that need to set
  in order to apply a DL algorithm to a dataset. Even in a simple neural network,
  numerous hyperparameters need to be configured. The optimal combination of
  hyperparameters depends on the specific problem and a set of suitable hyperparameters
  are required each time. This makes our tool a good solution for applying DL to
  Genomic Prediction problems.

  ### Deep Learning hyperparameters

   |Term|Definition|
   |:----:|----------|
   |**Activation functions**|The mathematical function f that produces neuron’s output f(w’x + b), where w is a weights vector, x is an input vector, and b is bias, a scalar. Both w and b are to be estimated for all neurons.|
   |**Batch**|In **Stochastic Gradient Descent** algorithms, each of the sample partitions within a given **epoch**.|
   |**Dropout**|Dropout means that a given percentage of neurons output is set to zero. The percentage is kept constant, but the specific neurons are randomly sampled in every iteration. The goal of dropout is to avoid overfitting.|
   |**Kernel = Filter = Tensor**|In DL terminology, the kernel is a multidimensional array of weights.|
   |**Learning rate**|Specify the speed of gradient update.|
   |**Loss**|Loss function measures how differences between observed and predicted target variables are quantified.|
   |**Neural layer**|‘Neurons’ are arranged in layers, i.e., groups of neurons that take the output of previous group of neurons as input |
   |**Neuron**|The basic unit of a DL algorithm. A ‘neuron’ takes as input a list of variable values (x) multiplied by ‘weights’ (w) and, as output, produces a non-linear transformation f(w’x + b) where f is the activation function and b is the bias. Both w and b need to be estimated for each neuron such that the loss is minimized across the whole set of neurons.|
   |**Optimizer**|Algorithm to find weights (w and b) that minimize the loss function. Most DL optimizers are based on **Stochastic Gradient Descent** (SGD).|
   |**Pooling**|A pooling function substitutes the output of a network at a certain location with a summary statistic of the neighboring outputs. This is one of the crucial steps on the CNN architecture. The most common pooling operations are maximum, mean, median.|
   |**Weight regularization**|An excess of parameters (weights, w) may produce the phenomenon called ‘overfitting’, which means that the model adjusts to the observed data very well, but prediction of new unobserved data is very poor. To avoid this, weights are estimated subject to constraints, a strategy called ‘penalization’ or ‘regularization’. The two most frequent regularizations are the L1 and L2 norms, which set restrictions on the sum of absolute values of w (L1) or of the square values (L2)|
